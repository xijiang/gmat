## Simulation of a pedigree

### Steps
1. 10 chromosomes of an ideal population of ne=120
2. dropped into a pedigree of
   * 10 generations
   * full sib size = 10
   * total 6000 ID
3. sample QTL

### Output one file 
   * File 1: ID Pa Ma genotypes(012) TBV
   * File 2: locus(start from 0) QTL-effect
   * File 3: inbreeding coefficient of every ID

### Purposes
This is (currently) to test my absorption procedure.
